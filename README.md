Hello 
This is my first IoT Project.

We can use this system in our garage and warehouse. This security system is cost effect and also wi-fi enable.

Tools and Technologies Used: - 
-------------------------------

➢ Arduino (As a code editor & compiler) 

➢ Proteus (For visualization of output) 

➢ C/C++ language 

➢ IRs

➢ Buzzers 


About The Solved Problem Statement/Device: - 
-----------------------------------------------------------

If we discuss about the specification of my device then my device can solve the security problem from a distance like any one can implement this device in their garage, parking area etc.

There are IRs or Infra Red sensors and a buzzer is used to implement the device , this  device can also be used as a digital eye, means if this is implemented somewhere then it sense  the movement from a distance and send the feedback to the user and the buzzer also starts ringing...
